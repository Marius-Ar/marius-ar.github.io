## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties & nesting
- Flex
- Docker

### What I learned

Deploying my solution using GitHub Pages

The Frontend Mentor workflow

### Continued development

I need to keep on practicing how to integrate UI from a design, which is more akin to a "real-life" workflow

I need to learn more about creating accessible web pages

I'd like to delve into GitHub Actions to deploy more complex websites on platforms other than GitHub Pages
